# October 2012 Iowa City Iowa JS Meeting Notes

http://meetup.iowajs.org/events/86578302/

## Ember.js

[Toran Billups](http://toranbillups.com/blog/) came up from Des Moines and gave a demo of [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/). No need to worry if you missed it: Toran has a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/toranb/ember-code-camp) with all the code, and a [screencast on his website](http://toranbillups.com/blog/archive/2012/10/14/Getting-started-with-ember-js/) walking through the whole thing. It's very well done.

He'll be talking about it more at [Iowa Code Camp](http://iowacodecamp.com/), which you can still register for right now.

## Other Stuff

We talked a little bit about languages, specifically those that compile down to JavaScript and other intersting VM technologies. Things like:

* [ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript)
* [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/)
* [Opal](http://opalrb.org/)
* [PNaCl](http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/)

Ben Oakes was there and mentioned a couple of projects he's working on:

* [TabCarousel](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tabcarousel/ddldimidiliclngjipajmjjiakhbcohn)
* [Maid](https://github.com/benjaminoakes/maid)

The topic for the next meetup is still wide open, we did mention continuing the battle of the frameworks. [Closure Tools](https://developers.google.com/closure/)? [Dojo](https://developers.google.com/closure/) perhaps?
